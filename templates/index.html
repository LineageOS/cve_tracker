            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <span>The CVE tracker is a manual way to keep track of the patch status of CVEs for the kernels we use for the devices</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>CVEs?</h3>
            <span>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In a few words: These are basically security holes which <i>can</i> (mostly not even that) be used to
            get access to your device's data</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>The kernel for my device is only at x%, why is it so insecure?</h3>
            <span>First please note that the tracker has to be manually maintained by each device maintainer. It does not necessarily represent the 
            actual patch status of the kernel. Additionally only very few of the CVEs can actually be used to exploit your data, others are just theoretical security holes and
            can't be used due to other security measures like SELinux etc.</span>
